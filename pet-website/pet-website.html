  <h2>Sophie's favorite things:</h2>

  <h3>Friends</h3>
  <p>Sophie is very particular with who she socializes with. We don't know her past, but suspect she had a hard puppyhood. She doesn't care too much for roudy dogs, but she loves her younger dog brother, Andy. Below are her friends listed in order:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Andy (dog)</li>
    <li>Joel (human)</li>
    <li>Terry (human)</li>
    <li> Carol (human)</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Foods</h3>
  <p>Sophie is a rescue dog with an unknown past. We don't typically food our dogs "human food" due to bad begging behavior, but sometimes we make an exception. Below are Sohpie's faviorite human foods in no particular order:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pizza</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Steak</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Before Sophie's brother came around, she was not very food motivated. Now that she has competition, she is  more motivated by food.</p>
